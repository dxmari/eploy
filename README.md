Let's go to the client side setup.

### Usage in Client Side

First you have to create a **'eploy.config.js'** in a root folder.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    apps: [{
        name: '<your-application-name>',
        main : '<main-file>' //optional
    }],
    cloud_config: {
        staging : {
            host: '<your-public-ip-address-or-domain-url-name>',
            repo: '<your-git-repo-path>', // Clone type must be ssh, not supported in https.
            ref: '<your-git-branch-name-with-ref>',  // eg. origin/master
            application_path: '<your-application-path-in-a-server>',
            pre_launch_script: '<launch-script>' // It will execute after update the latest files from the git. eg. 'npm i'
        },
        production : {
            host: '<your-public-ip-address-or-domain-url-name>',
            repo: '<your-git-repo-path>', // Clone type must be ssh, not supported in https.
            ref: '<your-git-branch-name-with-ref>',  // eg. origin/master
            application_path: '<your-application-path-in-a-server>',
            pre_launch_script: '<launch-script>',  //It will execute after update the latest files from the git. eg. 'npm i'
        }
    },
    transfer_config : {
        staging : {
            host: '<your-public-ip-address-or-domain-url-name>',
            user : '<your-server-username>', // eg. ubuntu or root
            source_path : '<source-path-transfer-from>', // which is folder or file path you want to transfer to server
            destination_path : '<destination-path-transfer-to>',
            pre_transfer_script : '<launch-script>', // It will execute before transfer the files to the server. eg. 'ng build or gatsby build'
        },
        production : {
           host: '<your-public-ip-address-or-domain-url-name>',
            user : '<your-server-username>', // eg. ubuntu or root
            source_path : '<source-path-transfer-from>', // which is folder or file path you want to transfer to server
            destination_path : '<destination-path-transfer-to>',
            pre_transfer_script : '<launch-script>', // It will execute before transfer the files to the server. eg. 'ng build or gatsby build'
        }
    }
}
```

The above file explains the configuration of eploy service. In cloud_config or transfer_config must having 'staging' or 'production' attribute.
